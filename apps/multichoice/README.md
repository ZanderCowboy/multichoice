# multichoice

The `Multichoice` application can be used to manage a list of entries, by sorting it into customizable columns using `tabs` and adding individual items to those using `cards`. It can range from TODOs, books to read, ticket management, or even to sorting what movies or series you will either watch, are busy watching, or have finised watching.
