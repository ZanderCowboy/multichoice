# Complex Glob Patterns Example

This demonstrates advanced glob pattern usage.

## Glob Pattern Features

### Inclusion Patterns
- `packages/**/*.dart` - All Dart files in packages directory
- `apps/**/lib/features/**/*.dart` - All Dart files in feature directories

### Exclusion Patterns (using `!`)
- `!**/*.g.dart` - Exclude generated files
- `!**/*.freezed.dart` - Exclude Freezed generated files
- `!**/*.mocks.dart` - Exclude mock files

## Use Cases
- Apply rules to source files but not generated files
- Target specific directory structures
- Exclude test files or build artifacts
- Create rules for specific package types

## Pattern Examples
```yaml
globs:
  # Include patterns
  - "**/*.dart"                    # All Dart files
  - "packages/core/**"             # Everything in core package
  - "apps/**/lib/**"               # All lib directories in apps
  - "**/*.{dart,ts,js}"            # Multiple file extensions
  
  # Exclude patterns (must come after includes)
  - "!**/test/**"                  # Exclude test directories
  - "!**/*.g.dart"                 # Exclude generated files
  - "!**/node_modules/**"          # Exclude dependencies
```
