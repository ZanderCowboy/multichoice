# Conditional Rules Example

This rule file demonstrates how to create rules that apply only to specific directories or file patterns.

## Usage
- `globs`: Can target specific directories or file patterns
- This example applies to core packages and feature directories
- Useful for domain-specific conventions

## Core Package Rules
- All services must have corresponding interfaces
- Interfaces go in `interfaces/` directory
- Implementations go in `implementations/` directory
- Use dependency injection for all services

## Feature Module Rules
- Each feature should be self-contained
- Follow the data/domain/presentation structure
- Use barrel exports (`export.dart`) for public API
- Keep feature dependencies minimal
