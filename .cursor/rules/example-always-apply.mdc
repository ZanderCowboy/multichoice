# Always Apply Rules Example

This rule file demonstrates how to create rules that **always apply** to every conversation, regardless of context.

## Usage
- `alwaysApply: true` - Makes these rules active in every conversation
- `globs` can be empty when using `alwaysApply: true`
- Use this for project-wide conventions and critical guidelines

## Project-Wide Rules
1. **Never commit secrets or API keys** - Always use environment variables
2. **Write tests for new features** - Maintain at least 80% coverage
3. **Follow conventional commits** - Use format: `type(scope): message`
4. **Run linter before committing** - Fix all warnings and errors
5. **Document public APIs** - Add doc comments for exported functions/classes

## Code Quality Standards
- All code must pass static analysis
- All tests must pass before merging
- Code reviews are required for all PRs
- Keep functions under 50 lines when possible
