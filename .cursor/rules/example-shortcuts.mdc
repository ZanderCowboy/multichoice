# Quick Reference Shortcuts

This file provides quick reference for common tasks and shortcuts.

## Build Commands
- `make db` - Run build_runner for code generation
- `make fb` - Flutter build with code generation
- `make frb` - Full Flutter rebuild (clean + code generation)
- `make clean` - Clean all generated files
- `make mr` - Melos rebuild all packages

## Testing Commands
- `melos test:all` - Run all tests
- `melos test:core` - Run core package tests
- `melos test:multichoice` - Run main app tests
- `melos coverage:all` - Generate coverage reports

## Code Generation
- When mocks are needed: Check for `mocks.dart` first, then use `melos` for build_runner
- Generated file patterns:
  - `*.g.dart` - General generated code
  - `*.freezed.dart` - Freezed models
  - `*.mocks.dart` - Test mocks
  - `*.auto_mappr.dart` - Object mapping

## File Organization
- Services: `interfaces/` and `implementations/` directories
- Constants: Check `/constants` folder first
- Tests: Mirror source structure, use `mocks.dart` when available
- Exports: Use `export.dart` for barrel files

## Quick Tips
- Use `const` constructors when possible
- Check existing constants before creating new ones
- Use `part`/`part of` for modular widget classes
- Keep `part` sections alphabetical
