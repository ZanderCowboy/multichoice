# Testing Rules Example

This rule file demonstrates rules that apply only to test files.

## Usage
- Targets all test files using multiple glob patterns
- Ensures consistent testing practices across the project

## Testing Conventions
1. **Test File Naming**
   - Unit tests: `*_test.dart` or `*.test.dart`
   - Widget tests: `*_widget_test.dart`
   - Integration tests: `*_integration_test.dart`

2. **Test Structure**
   - Use `setUp()` and `tearDown()` for common setup
   - Group related tests with `group()`
   - Use descriptive test names: `test('should return error when user is null')`

3. **Mocking**
   - Check for existing `mocks.dart` files first
   - Use `mockito` for generating mocks
   - Run `melos` for build_runner when mocks are needed

4. **Coverage**
   - Aim for 80%+ coverage
   - Focus on business logic coverage
   - Don't test implementation details

## Test Organization
- Place tests next to the code they test
- Use `test/` directory for test files
- Mirror the source directory structure in tests
