Please look at the `git diffs` and update the CHANGELOG.md (path: `CHANGELOG.md`) in a bullet list format. 

Follow this structure:
```
#<ticket-number> - GitHub Issue Title

- Item
- Item
```

To get the ticket number, look at the number at the start of the current branch. 
The title should be in Camel Case
Replace the existing contents.
Do not over explain. It should just have enough details to capture the purpose of the code changes.
