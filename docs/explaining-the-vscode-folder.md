# `.vscode` folder

This will go over all the files found in the `.vscode` folder for clarity

## extensions.json

This file specifies which extensions should be installed by the VS Code client when you open the project.

## launch.json

This file contains the `RUN AND DEBUG` configurations that can be used in the project for VS Code users.

## settings.json

Local settings used by VS Code

## snippets.code-snippets

Contains code snippets that can be used to speed up development. Currently, the snippets are primarily for writing tests.

## tasks.json

Tasks can be used to run commands that are regularly used. For example, uninstalling an app from an emulator (this is quicker because there is no need to manually access the emulator, find the app and uninstall it).

## test_launch.json

This is not a stardard VS Code file, and does not necessarily have use in the codebase. In case it can be used, it can for example be used to run integration tests.
